Basically, we all worked together in all components of this project. 


Organization of the submission:
Heartwave.zip
Comp 3004 Team Project.pdf
UML.png
Use_Case_Diagram.png
README.txt

Steps to run the program:
1) unzip Heartwave.zip file
2) open the Heartwave folder in QT creator
3) select CMakeLists.txt to open in QT creator
4) build and run the program
5) There might be some error messages that pop up in the terminal. 
we disregard them. The error is because of the newly created build file. 
To fix the error, we copy paste all the svg files from Heartwave folder to the
debugging folder and then build and run the program again.

Pressing buttons successively may crash the program but you can build and run it again

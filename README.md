# HRV Monitoring System
**Developed By:** Md Ishraq Tanzim

## Overview

The HeartWave HRV Monitoring System is an innovative device designed to measure, analyze, and display Heart Rate Variability (HRV) patterns, offering users real-time biofeedback on their coherence levels. Aimed at reducing stress and promoting well-being, the HeartWave is inspired by HeartMath Institute's technology, integrating advanced heart rate monitoring to facilitate a high state of coherenceâ€”a psychophysiological state indicative of health and wellness.

## Features
- Real-time HRV analysis and coherence level feedback
- User-friendly interface with a display for heart rhythm and coherence indicators
- History/log feature for tracking progress over time
- Settings for personalization and challenge levels
- Battery charge indicator and session summary view

## Getting Started
To compile, build, and run the HeartWave system in QT Creator on Linux, follow the step-by-step tutorial available at https://youtu.be/XLX6hEDgdv4

## Prerequisites
- QT Creator for Linux installed on your system
- CMake for project configuration

## Installation
- Unzip the Heartwave.zip file.
- Open the Heartwave folder in QT Creator.
- Select CMakeLists.txt to open the project in QT Creator.

## Build and Run
- Build the project by selecting the build option in QT Creator.
- Run the program. If error messages appear, copy the SVG files from the Heartwave folder to the debugging folder, then build and run again.

**Note:** Successive button presses may cause the program to crash; simply rebuild and run if this occurs.

HRV Monitoring System

**Overview**

The HRV Monitoring System, developed by Md Ishraq Tanzim, is an advanced tool designed to analyze heart rate variability (HRV) to aid in the assessment of cardiac health. This system utilizes state-of-the-art software engineering principles to provide accurate and real-time HRV data analysis.
Features:

    Real-time HRV data analysis
    User-friendly interface for both clinicians and patients
    Comprehensive UML and Use Case Diagrams for system design clarity

**Getting Started**

Prerequisites:

    QT Creator installed on your system
    CMake for project configuration

Installation:

    Unzip the Heartwave.zip file.
    Open the Heartwave folder in QT Creator.
    Select CMakeLists.txt to open the project in QT Creator.

Build and Run:

    Build the project by selecting the build option in QT Creator.
